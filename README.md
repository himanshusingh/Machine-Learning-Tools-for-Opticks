This is a reporsitory for GSoc 2012 project **Spectral Algorithm Development for Opticks**.
For more information about Opticks: http://www.opticks.org

Opticks uses Spectral Processing Extension to perform hyperspectral and multispectral image analysis. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue. This help in uniquely identifying objects based on their spectral signatures, correctly clustering a image into components and detect changes in the image. These techniques form an integral part of spectral image analysis.

The repository contains the following Machine Learning techniques/algorithms:
```
* ISODATA Clustering
* Change Detection using an EM based approach
* SVM Classification
* Back Propagation Neural Networks
```
