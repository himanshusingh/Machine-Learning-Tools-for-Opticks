This is the reporsitory for Google Summer of Code 2012 project **Spectral Algorithm Development for Opticks**.
For more information about Opticks visit http://www.opticks.org

Opticks uses Spectral Processing Extension to perform hyperspectral and multispectral image analysis. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue.
This help in uniquely identifying objects based on their spectral signatures, correctly clustering a image into components and detect changes in the image. These techniques form an integral part of spectral image analysis.

The additional information present in spectral images can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms in order to achieve very high accuracy in object identification in an image. 
Same goes for the unsupervised algorithms used to cluster and detect changes in an image.

The repository contains the following Machine Learning techniques/algorithms:
```
* ISODATA Clustering
* Change Detection using an EM based approach
* SVM Classification
* Back Propagation Neural Networks
```
