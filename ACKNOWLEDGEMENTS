The build system is taken as is from the Spectral Processing extension[1] with some minor modifications.

ISODATA plugin is based on the ISODATA algorithm presented in [2].
ISODATA plugin's code is based on the k-means plugin present in the spectral processing extension[1].

ChangeDetectionEM plugin is based on the technique described in [3].

SVM plugin uses SMO for training, the code for SMO is based on the pseudocode presented in [4].
