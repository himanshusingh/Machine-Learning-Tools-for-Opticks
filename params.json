Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue. This help in uniquely identifying objects based on their spectral signatures, correctly clustering a image into components and detect changes in the image. These techniques form an integral part of spectral image analysis.\r\n\r\nThe repository contain the following Machine Learning techniques/algorithms:\r\n```\r\n* ISODATA Clustering\r\n* Change Detection using an EM based approach\r\n* SVM Classification\r\n* Back Propagation Neural Networks\r\n```","tagline":"Plugins based on Machine Learning techniques."}
