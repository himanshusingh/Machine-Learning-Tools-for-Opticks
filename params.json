{"name":"Machine Learning Tools for Opticks","tagline":"Plugins based on Machine Learning algorithms.","body":"This is the repository for Google Summer of Code 2012 project _Spectral Algorithm Development for Opticks_.\r\nFor more information about Opticks visit http://www.opticks.org.\r\n\r\nOpticks uses Spectral Processing Extension to perform hyperspectral and multispectral image analysis. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue. This help in uniquely identifying objects based on their spectral signatures, correctly clustering a image into components and detecting changes in the image. These techniques form an integral part of spectral image analysis.\r\n\r\nThe additional information present in spectral images can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms in order to achieve very high accuracy in object identification in an image. Same goes for the unsupervised algorithms used to cluster and detect changes in an image.\r\n\r\nThe repository contain the following Machine Learning techniques/algorithms:\r\n```\r\n* ISODATA Clustering\r\n* Change Detection using an EM based approach\r\n* SVM Classification\r\n* Back Propagation Neural Networks\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The Plugins:\r\n***\r\n#### ISODATA\r\nISODATA is used to cluster an image. The ISODATA algorithm is similar to the k-means algorithm with the distinct difference that the ISODATA algorithm allows for different number of clusters while the k-means assumes that the number of clusters is known a priori. \r\nHere we use ISODATA for clustering spectral image. All the original images below are taken from the [Opticks Sample Data](http://opticks.org/confluence/display/opticks/Sample+Data).\r\nThe Code is available here: [ISODATA](https://github.com/himanshusingh/Machine-Learning-Tools-for-Opticks/blob/master/Code/ISODATA/)\r\n###### Original Image\r\n![original image](http://i.imgur.com/B05iD.jpg)\r\n###### ISODATA running on the image.\r\n![ISODATA running](http://i.imgur.com/Uv6jzd2.png)\r\n###### After first iteration of ISODATA.\r\n![first iteration](http://i.imgur.com/SsYPo.png)\r\n###### After second iteration of ISODATA.\r\n![second iteration](http://i.imgur.com/BsqTA.png)\r\n###### After third iteration of ISODATA.\r\n![third iteration](http://i.imgur.com/7bwn9.png)\r\n###### After fourth iteration of ISODATA.\r\n![fourth iteration](http://i.imgur.com/7bwn9.png)\r\n###### The clustered image obtained after the final iteration.\r\n![fifth iteration](http://i.imgur.com/8qrPh.png)\r\n![original image](http://i.imgur.com/B05iD.jpg)\r\n***\r\n#### Change Detection using EM\r\nThis plugin uses an EM based approach for unsupervised change detection. It is based on [Automatic Analysis of the Difference Image for Unsupervised Change Detection](http://rslab.disi.unitn.it/papers/R17-CD-EM-Gauss.pdf).\r\n###### Image of Delaware Bay taken on 23 September 1999 \r\n![original image](http://i.imgur.com/f9ZTUZB.jpg)\r\n###### Image of Delaware Bay taken on 10 July 2001 \r\n![changed image](http://i.imgur.com/vEQ9Ecc.png)\r\n###### The algorithm running on difference image\r\n![EM running](http://i.imgur.com/0E04zYw.png)\r\n###### Detected Changes(shown in Black)\r\n![changes](http://i.imgur.com/7EBHxSD.png)\r\n***","google":"UA-38578308-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
